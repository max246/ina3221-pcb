# INA3221 PCB 

This is an opensource PCB which I provide to everyone who will need to implement on their project or just to have a hack for it.

My skills on PCB are not that great so you might find some odd routing but you can adjust that by yourself from the schematic.


The Shut resistor is a 0.1 ohm 2512 at 2W, that gaves me a good result on the reading.
